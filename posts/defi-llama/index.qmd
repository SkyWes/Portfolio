### Defi Llama
[Defi Llama](https://defillama.com/) is a defi research and tracking website with a public REST API. I designed a simple interface to quickly find new or fast moving defi projects, filtered by type or chain, with search options to find specific protocols.

I used PowerBI to connect to web sources. I transformed the json data in powerquery and removed the data I wasn't interested in. After building a few table relationships and measure, I designed and built a dashboard.
